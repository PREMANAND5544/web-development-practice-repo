    <pre>Purpose:
        CivicConnect is a mobile and web application designed to facilitate seamless interaction between citizens and their government. It provides access to government services, real-time updates on local and national policies, and a platform for civic engagement.

        Integrated online application forms and tracking system for documents.
        Local Governance Interaction:
        
        Users can locate their local representatives (mayors, city council members) and directly communicate with them via secure messaging or by booking appointments.
        Local event notifications (town halls, community meetings).
        Public Complaint and Feedback System:

        Real-time tracking of submitted complaints and responses from government officials.

        A public portal where users can track government spending, project progress, and national budget allocations.
